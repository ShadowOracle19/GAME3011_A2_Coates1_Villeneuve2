ADVANCED GAME PROGRAMMING
ASSIGNMENT 2, GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

This lockpicking system would be designed for some sort of open world game or puzzle game.
The lock can be accessed by pressing an input key while near a door (right now it's E but it could be anything)
Once the lock is accessed, movement is disabled and you can use your mouse to rotate the pick, by moving your mouse left and right.
Once you think the pick is in the right place, press D (right) to push it and attempt to unlock.
Pressing D will use an attempt, or a "pick". Your difficulty dictates how many picks you have.
If you are close, the game will let you know. If you succeed, that is, are within range of the unlock value, the door opens
We have easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty has a timer, this timer remains the same regardless of player skill.
Easy gives you 60 seconds and 10 attempts, and the range value is large.
Medium gives you 30 seconds and 8 attempts, with an intermediate range.
Hard gives you 20 seconds and 6 attempts, with a narrow range.
The player's skill affects the range of success. The higher your skill, the larger the range of success will be.
Skill does not affect time or attempts, only the range of success. Skill linearly progresses, and at skill level 10, the range of success will double.
